2-1: 
To run gdb compiler on the executable file, the command "gdb ./debugTst" was
entered. As the gdb attemps to run the command line option "run divide", the
program crashed on line 24 with a report of program received signal SIGFPE,
Arithmetic exception.

0x000000000040066b in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffe208) at debugTst.c:24
24      debugTst.c: No such file or directory.
        in debugTst.c

2-2:
By setting a break point on line 23 just before the program crash location,
using the command "break 23". Then the program is recompiled. The argument
count is 2 and argument vector is 0x7fffffffe208 for the main function.


3-1: 
When running the program using valgrind memory check command, there are
2,048 bytes in 1 blocks in use at exit, which means 2,048 bytes in 1 blocks
are definitely lost.

3-2:
As the program is reran with "good"
total heap usage: 1 allocs, 1 frees, 4,094 bytes allocated

Makefile implementation

The Makefile is consist of five sections, they are test, clean, mem, all and
help. 
Make all command builds the dynamic array and test code binary.
Make test command will use the generated executable file named TDA and
take "us-eng-words.txt" as input data file, it stores the result in out.txt
and prints out the result that is consist of first and last 6 words in the
file, as well as the total number of words.
Make mem command will run the functional test using valgrind and stores the
valgrind memory analysis result in the mem.txt, then it prints out the memory
analysis, it will take about 2 minutes for valgrind to process.
Make help commad will display all the available make options.
Make clean command deletes the generated .o files as well as the output files.
