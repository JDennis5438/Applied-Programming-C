Total C file size when using "size -A" command: 5810

By analyze the result from above, in terms of the speed, it's apparent that
C program takes less time to read the data input file and is much faster at 
calculating the result. In terms of the size, C++ program files are much 
larger than the C program files. Overall speaking, C program is both smaller and
faster than C++ program which is a better choice.
